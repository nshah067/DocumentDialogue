About the Interdisciplinary Science Program  The interdisciplinary science major is designed to provide College of Science students with a broad base in the 
sciences. By combining a primary area of science study, an interdisciplinary science core, a support ing area of 
academic interest and the core curriculum shared by all College of Science programs, students explore how the 
disciplines of science come together to identify and solve scientific challenges. Students customize the major by 
selecting a departme ntal or interdepartmental primary area based in science and a supporting area that complements or 
enhances the primary area. This supporting area may be an approved minor from any college or school at the 
University or a concentration of 18 credits of cour ses with a unifying theme. There is a primary area representing each 
department in the College of Science, however, cross -disciplinary areas may be explored and added as appropriate. 
With the help of either a faculty member or an academic advisor, students  are encouraged to petition for approval of 
their supporting area.  
The Interdisciplinary Science Major is designed to give a student a broad base in the sciences with more depth in a 
Primary Area of Science and a Supporting Area, usually outside of Science . The Core courses are common across the 
major but the student customizes the major by selecting a departmental or interdepartmental Primary Area based in 
Science and a Supporting Area which may come from any college or school at the University. There is a  Primary Area 
representing each department in the College of Science and cross -disciplinary areas will be explored and added as 
appropriate. Several Supporting Areas will be suggested and a student may petition for approval of others.  
Students completing t he interdisciplinary science major have gone on to a variety of careers - some in, and others out 
of, the world of science. These careers include medicine, lay and other advanced -study professions, scientific sales, 
technical and scientific writing, comput er programming and engineering.

The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurs es, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   World Language Courses  
World Language proficiency requirements  vary by  program. The following list is inclusive of all world languages PWL 
offers for credit; for acceptable languages and proficiency levels, see your advisor. (ASL -American Sign Language;

Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".

Interdisciplinary Science, BS (Computer Science)  About the Interdisciplinary Science Program  
The interdisciplinary science major is designed to provide College of Science students with a broad base in the 
sciences. By combining a primary area of science study, an interdisciplinary science core, a supporting area of 
academic interest and the core curriculum shared by all College of Science programs, students explore how the 
disciplines of science come together to identify and solve scientific challenges. Students customize the major by 
selecting a  departmental or interdepartmental primary area based in science and a supporting area that complements or 
enhances the primary area. This supporting area may be an approved minor from any college or school at the 
University or a concentration of 18 credit s of courses with a unifying theme. There is a primary area representing each 
department in the College of Science, however, cross -disciplinary areas may be explored and added as appropriate. 
With the help of either a faculty member or an academic advisor,  students are encouraged to petition for approval of 
their supporting area.  
The Interdisciplinary Science Major is designed to give a student a broad base in the sciences with more depth in a 
Primary Area of Science and a Supporting Area, usually outside o f Science. The Core courses are common across the 
major but the student customizes the major by selecting a departmental or interdepartmental Primary Area based in 
Science and a Supporting Area which may come from any college or school at the University. T here is a Primary Area 
representing each department in the College of Science and cross -disciplinary areas will be explored and added as 
appropriate. Several Supporting Areas will be suggested and a student may petition for approval of others.  
Students com pleting the interdisciplinary science major have gone on to a variety of careers - some in, and others out 
of, the world of science. These careers include medicine, lay and other advanced -study professions, scientific sales, 
technical and scientific writin g, computer programming and engineering.

The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pur suant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
World Language Courses  
World Language proficiency requirements vary by  program. The following list is inclusive of all world languages PWL 
offers for credit; for acceptable languages and proficiency levels, see your advisor. (ASL -American Sign Language;

Planetary Sciences)  
About the Interdisciplinary Science Program  
The interdisciplinar y science major is designed to provide College of Science students with a broad base in the 
sciences. By combining a primary area of science study, an interdisciplinary science core, a supporting area of 
academic interest and the core curriculum shared by all College of Science programs, students explore how the 
disciplines of science come together to identify and solve scientific challenges. Students customize the major by selecting a departmental or interdepartmental primary area based in science and a su pporting area that complements or 
enhances the primary area. This supporting area may be an approved minor from any college or school at the 
University or a concentration of 18 credits of courses with a unifying theme. There is a primary area representing each 
department in the College of Science, however, cross -disciplinary areas may be explored and added as appropriate. 
With the help of either a faculty member or an academic advisor, students are encouraged to petition for approval of 
their supporting are a. 
The Interdisciplinary Science Major is designed to give a student a broad base in the sciences with more depth in a 
Primary Area of Science and a Supporting Area, usually outside of Science. The Core courses are common across the 
major but the student c ustomizes the major by selecting a departmental or interdepartmental Primary Area based in 
Science and a Supporting Area which may come from any college or school at the University. There is a Primary Area 
representing each department in the College of Sci ence and cross -disciplinary areas will be explored and added as 
appropriate. Several Supporting Areas will be suggested and a student may petition for approval of others.  
Students completing the interdisciplinary science major have gone on to a variety of careers - some in, and others out 
of, the world of science. These careers include medicine, lay and other advanced -study professions, scientific sales, 
technical and scientific writing, computer programming and engineering.

About the Interdisciplinary Science Program  
The interdisciplinary science major is designed to provide College of Science students with a broad base in the 
sciences. By combining a primary area of science study, an interdisciplinary science core, a supporting area of 
academic interest and the core curriculum shared by all College of Science programs, students explo re how the 
disciplines of science come together to identify and solve scientific challenges. Students customize the major by 
selecting a departmental or interdepartmental primary area based in science and a supporting area that complements or 
enhances the primary area. This supporting area may be an approved minor from any college or school at the 
University or a concentration of 18 credits of courses with a unifying theme. There is a primary area representing each 
department in the College of Science, howe ver, cross -disciplinary areas may be explored and added as appropriate. 
With the help of either a faculty member or an academic advisor, students are encouraged to petition for approval of 
their supporting area.  
The Interdisciplinary Science Major is desig ned to give a student a broad base in the sciences with more depth in a 
Primary Area of Science and a Supporting Area, usually outside of Science. The Core courses are common across the 
major but the student customizes the major by selecting a departmental  or interdepartmental Primary Area based in 
Science and a Supporting Area which may come from any college or school at the University. There is a Primary Area 
representing each department in the College of Science and cross -disciplinary areas will be explo red and added as 
appropriate. Several Supporting Areas will be suggested and a student may petition for approval of others.  
Students completing the interdisciplinary science major have gone on to a variety of careers - some in, and others out 
of, the world  of science. These careers include medicine, lay and other advanced -study professions, scientific sales, 
technical and scientific writing, computer programming and engineering.

must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for exampl e, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
World Language Courses  
World Language proficiency requirements vary by  progr am. The following list is inclusive of all world languages PWL

Interdisciplinary Science, BS (Statistics)  
About the Interdisciplinary Sc ience Program  
The interdisciplinary science major is designed to provide College of Science students with a broad base in the 
sciences. By combining a primary area of science study, an interdisciplinary science core, a supporting area of 
academic interest and the core curriculum shared by all College of Science programs, students explore how the 
disciplines of science come together to identify and solve scientific challenges. Students customize the major by 
selecting a departmental or interdepartmental prim ary area based in science and a supporting area that complements or 
enhances the primary area. This supporting area may be an approved minor from any college or school at the 
University or a concentration of 18 credits of courses with a unifying theme. The re is a primary area representing each 
department in the College of Science, however, cross -disciplinary areas may be explored and added as appropriate. 
With the help of either a faculty member or an academic advisor, students are encouraged to petition fo r approval of 
their supporting area.  
The Interdisciplinary Science Major is designed to give a student a broad base in the sciences with more depth in a 
Primary Area of Science and a Supporting Area, usually outside of Science. The Core courses are common across the 
major but the student customizes the major by selecting a departmental or interdepartmental Primary Area based in 
Science and a Supporting Area which may come from any college or school at the University. There is a Primary Area 
representing eac h department in the College of Science and cross -disciplinary areas will be explored and added as 
appropriate. Several Supporting Areas will be suggested and a student may petition for approval of others.  
Students completing the interdisciplinary science major have gone on to a variety of careers - some in, and others out 
of, the world of science. These careers include medicine, lay and other advanced -study professions, scientific sales, 
technical and scien tific writing, computer programming and engineering.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public  Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nur ses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.

The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for e xample, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and comple ting all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.

Learning Beyond the Classroom Certificate  
Learning Beyond the Classroom (LBC) is open only to students majoring in the College of Science. It is a voluntary 
program aimed at encouraging you, the College of Science student, to engage in activities that provide hands -on 
experience and opportunities to apply classroom knowledge. Successful completion of the LBC program will be noted 
on your official Purdue transcript. You will also receive a certificate of completion.  
Participation in LBC involves attending, organizing, or leading activities that fall into three general categories: career 
and professional development; service, citizenship and leadership; and experience with domestic and international 
diversity. Progress  in each of the three areas is tracked by a point system. Points are earned by submitting reports on 
participation in activities. The number of points earned varies with the intensity of the activity.  
Learning Beyond the Classroom website  
Requirements for the Certificate  
Completing the LBC certificate requires that you:  
1. Accumulate a total of 24 points, with at least 4 points in each of 3 categories.  
2. Participate in at least one intensive activity lasting an extended period of time, such as semester -long stud y 
abroad, full -time summer internship, two (consecutive) semesters of undergraduate research, an 
entrepreneurial activity together with the certificate of Entrepreneurship and Innovation,  and academic year 
resident assistant. Such an activity is worth 10 p oints.  
3. Include either  (a) 3 credits of approved coursework with grades of P or C - or higher  (one or more courses 
totaling 3 credits can meet this requirement) or (b) a semester -long study abroad program (worth 10 points) 
or some combination of spring break  (4 points) and/or summer study abroad activities (6 points), totaling 10 
points.  
4. In most cases, a maximum of 6 points per year and 10 points in total may be earned for any particular 
activity. It is estimated that completion of the certificate will take a pproximately 30 hours over your college 
career in addition to the intensive 10 -point activity described above.  
Learning Beyond the Classroom Details  
Courses  
Among the requirements of the Learning Beyond the Classroom Certificate Program is that you partici pate in either (a) 
approved coursework with grades of P (pass) or  C- or higher (one or more courses totaling 3 credits meets this 
requirement) or (b) semester -long study abroad or the equivalent.  Below you will find a table of courses that have been identi fied as meeting the objectives of this program. If there is an 
experiential course which is not here that you believe to be similar to those listed,  contact the  administrator. The

College of Science: No Count Course List  
College of Science: No Count Course List  
The College of Science has identified courses that do not meet any College of Science degree requirement. While 
similar, No Count course lists vary between departments.   
To review your department’s No Count list, cl ick on the departmental link below. Students pursuing more than one 
program should consult each department’s No count course list.   Duplicate course policy. A course will become a no count or duplicate course when a student completes two courses of 
similar  content. This situation can occur when a transfer course (Ex. AP/IB/dual credit) shares significant content with 
a Purdue course. Students should consult with their advisors to ensure they are not completing duplicate coursework.  
UCORE outcomes may be met  with No Count coursework.

Department of Biological Sciences  
About the Biological Sciences Program  
Discovery. This word captures our purpose, commitment, and vision. As a leading department in a major research 
university, our mission is to effectively integrate learning, discovery, and engagement in an  inclusive  environment . 
The best learning is experiential, and leads to a clear understanding of how discoveries are made, how science is 
conducted, and how ideas are communicated . The best learning is facilitated by faculty who are active in research and 
who can all engage students in the excitement of biology. And the best learning results in alumni who are well -
prepared to successfully pursue their chosen careers.  
As we discover  the many facets of biocomplexity, from vast ecosystems to the structure and function of individual 
molecules, we remain committed to our mission. Our faculty, staff, and students are engaged with the communities of 
science and education, the worlds of ind ustry and business, and our alumni and friends. To each individual who joins 
us, we promise opportunities to experience the excitement of discovery in biology. We welcome and encourage you to 
become a part of our team -as a student, alumnus, corporate partn er, scientific collaborator, or a member of our faculty 
and staff. Join us on our journey of learning, discovery, and engagement. Discover Biology at Purdue!

World Language Courses  
World Language proficiency requirements vary by  program. The following list is inclusive of all world languages PWL 
offers for credit; for acceptable langua ges and proficiency levels, see your advisor. (ASL -American Sign Language; 
ARAB -Arabic; CHNS -Chinese; FR -French; GER -German; GREK -Greek(Ancient); HEBR -Hebrew(Biblical); HEBR -

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a C ritical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized  for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.  
Cell, Molecular, and Developmental Biology, BS  
About the Program  Understanding how eukaryotic cells process information fr om their environment and initiate programs of gene 
expression leading to growth, development, and functional specification is the essence of a cell, molecular, and 
developmental (CMD) biology major. Students enrolled in this curriculum will take courses pr oviding a solid 
foundation in the molecular biology of cells and gain a full appreciation of how molecular complexes interact to make a 
cell function. This fundamental knowledge in cell and molecular biology will be applied through further coursework in 
genetics and developmental biology to examine how eukaryotic organisms function and how specific aspects of that 
function are perturbed by disease. Within the CMD major, students have the option of focusing their studies on animal 
systems, plant systems, or both. Graduates with a CMD major are well -prepared to pursue careers in academic or 
industrial research, biotechnology, genetic engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine, and other health -related 
professions.

World Language Courses  
World Language proficiency requirements vary by  program. The following list  is inclusive of all world languages PWL 
offers for credit; for acceptable languages and proficiency levels, see your advisor. (ASL -American Sign Language; 
ARAB -Arabic; CHNS -Chinese; FR -French; GER -German; GREK -Greek(Ancient); HEBR -Hebrew(Biblical); HEBR -
Hebrew(Modern); ITAL -Italian; JPNS -Japenese; KOR -Korean; LATN -Latin; PTGS=Portuguese; RUSS -Russian; 
SPAN -Spanish)  
Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree re quirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.  
Chemical Biology & Biochemistry, BS  
About  the Program  Biochemistry investigates the chemical and molecular foundations of life processes. A student may study the transfer of 
genetic information into biological structures, the conversion of nutrients into cell constituents and their utilization as  
sources of energy, the storage of memory, and the chemical nature of neural processes. Laboratory techniques include 
electrophoresis, chromatography, Western blotting, protein sequence analysis, and peptide mapping. Understanding the 
development and appli cation of enzymatic assays is fundamental to this field of study. This rigorous curriculum is 
excellent preparation for a number of careers in both academic and industrial research, including cancer and AIDS 
research, medicine, veterinary medicine, dentist ry, structural biology, genetics, and medicinal chemistry and drug 
development.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identif ied as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual studen t. 
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.  
Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology, BS  
About the Program  
This major investigates how organisms interact with their physical environment and other organisms, from an 
evolutionary perspective. Ecologists' work includes research and/or teaching involving population genetics and 
evolution, adaptive strategies for survival, the nature of populations, and community ecology. Ecologists also offer  
technical services in connection with environmental impact decisions and regional planning, and environmental 
education at various levels as teacher, naturalist, or journalist. Common career paths for undergraduate students include 
graduate study leading to academic positions (research and teaching in small colleges and major universities), technical 
positions in industry (mostly dealing with environmental assessment), and employment in state and federal 
environmental agencies.  Ecology, Evolution, and Envi ronmental Sciences Website

Genetics, BS  
About the Program  
Genetics is the science of in formation transfer from one generation to another. We learn the laws of inheritance in all 
creatures big and small, how they evolve and how they change. On the molecular level we learn about DNA and RNA, 
on the cellular level we discover what makes a cell cancerous, and on an organismal level we examine the reproductive 
habits of various organisms. Crucial principles include the structure, function, and transmission of genes. Laboratory 
techniques explore genetic engineering from the "inside." Genetics is c rucial to all of biology, hence a genetics major 
has great flexibility. This is excellent preparation for advanced study in biological sciences, law, genetic counseling, 
and many health -related professions.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Ed ucation (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient  in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

SPAN -Spanish)  Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for e xample, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for s pecific requirements and completion.  
Neurobiology and Physiology, BS  
About the Program  
Physiology is the study of the functions of living organisms and of the organ and tissue systems of which they are 
composed. The goal of physiology is to understand, in terms of physical and chemical principles, the mechanisms that 
operate in living organisms from the subcellular level to the level of the whole animal, with an emphasis on how these 
mechanisms are integrated to produce a viable organism.  
Neurobiology is th e study of the structure, function, and development of the nervous system, and originated, in part, as 
a subdiscipline of physiology. In recent years, neurobiology has become one of the most rapidly changing and exciting 
areas of biology. A neurobiology an d physiology major is excellent preparation for careers in education, research, 
industry, medicine, veterinary medicine, and other professions.

Laboratories(WTHR)  and the Herbert C. Brown Laboratory of Chemistry(BRWN) . Students, faculty, and staff have 
access to world class facilities both for teaching and research.  
Our Mission |  Our Vision  
The Department is home to:  
• 52 faculty members  
• 350 undergraduate students  • 310 graduate students  
• 90 support personnel  
In the 2013 Academic Ranking of World Universities (Shanghai Rankings), our departments ranked 20th world -wide 
and 13th nationally.  
The Department of Chemistry offers a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry (ACS accredited), a Bachelor of Science and a 
minor in Chemistry.   The department also offers an Honors program and  the opportunity to participate in Cooperative 
Education Program.  
Honors Program  
The Department of Chemistry has an honors program for superior students.   Participation can begin during the 
sophomore year, and a student will be assigned to advanced section s in chemistry courses.   During the junior and senior 
years, a student engages in undergraduate research, participates in research seminars and completes honor courses.   The 
undergraduate research experience (CHM 49900 or equivalent) is to be a minimum of six credits.   In addition, the 
student must write an honor's thesis based on the CHM 49900 work.   The faculty advisor will read the thesis and the 
student will give a presentation of the research.  
Admission to the chemistry honors program must be made by t he end of the junior year.   The honors student is 
expected to achieve and maintain a scholastic graduation index of at least 3.40.   Students fulfilling requirements of the 
chemistry honors program will be graduated "with honors in chemistry".   The honors p rogram has been approved by 
the Royal Society of Chemistry.  
Cooperative Education Program  
The Department of Chemistry participates in the Cooperative Education Program.   This program requires five years 
and involves the option of 3 or 5 work period session s, either semester or summer modules, with a cooperating 
company in the chemical industry.   As a student gains experience, she or he is given increasingly responsible industrial 
assignments and receives more compensation.   A student can enter the program m eeting the following 
requirements:   has completed two semesters of chemistry and has a chemistry index of 2.80.   Information is available 
from the Coordinator of Cooperative Education in the Department of Chemistry.   Check with your advisor for further

About the Program  
Biochemists study the chemical basis of life. Some of the major problems include the transfer of genetic information to 
biological structures, the conversion of nutrients into cell constituents and their utilization as sources of  energy, the 
storage of memory, and the chemical nature of neural processes. Furthermore, biochemists are interested in the 
chemical details of important processes such as photosynthesis, blood clotting, fertilization, and other functions that 
may be uniqu e to certain organisms.  This program includes five credits of undergraduate research in a wide range of 
fields, including drug discovery, nano -medicine, protein structure determination, development and application of novel 
chemical tools to dissect differe nt biological processes.  
 
By concentrating advanced elective credit hours in biochemistry and by taking biology courses, this degree provides an 
excellent preparation for medical, dental, or veterinary schools. This program would particularly benefit those  planning 
careers in medical research.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered cr itical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to p ersist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree pr ogram".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the kn owledge source for specific requirements and completion.

Critical Course  The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as " one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
ident ified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The m yPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignme nt with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed  in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaime r 
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.

Computer Science Honors: Computational Science and 
Engineering, BS  About the Program  
Students in the Computer Science Honors major, in addition to fulfilling all the requirements for a BS in Computer 
Science, will com plete additional coursework and a research project. Honors students must maintain an overall GPA of 
3.25 plus at least a 3.6 in Computer Science and required CSHO courses. The program requirements include additional 
math coursework, three out of four selec ted CS and ECE courses, a research seminar and project, and a graduate level 
course. It is especially suitable for students planning on graduate level coursework, though it also offers advantages to 
students seeking employment.  
Students are invited to declare the major if they meet the qualifications after their first semester or after completion of 
the six core courses. Students who have been admitted to the Honors College may also join the major. Students may 
also request to de clare the major if they meet qualifications no later than their seventh semester (student must have at 
least 2 academic semesters remaining to accommodate both the research seminar and the research project).  
This concentration is intended to introduce comp uter science basiscs in Computational Science and Engineering 
(CS&E). Students not intending to pursue an advanced degree are advised to choose Option 1 for electives and to take 
courses in some area of pure or applied science with the objective of learnin g how to develop software useful for the 
chosen area.

The ♦ course is considered critical.  In alignment wi th the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a  particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant  to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

Science, will complete additional coursework and a research project. Honors students must maintain an overall GPA of 
3.25 plus at least a 3.6  in Computer Science and required CSHO courses. The program requirements include additional 
math coursework, three out of four selected CS and ECE courses, a research seminar and project, and a graduate level 
course. It is especially suitable for students planning on graduate level coursework, though it also offers advantages to 
students seeking employment.  Machine Intelligence is designed to prepare students to work in fields related to 
management and analysis of data, including areas such as machine learn ing, information retrieval, and data mining. The 
track is designed to prepare students to understand, and effectively apply in practice, the principles and techniques of 
data and knowledge representation, search, as well as learning and reasoning with data . 
Students are invited to declare the major if they meet the qualifications after their first semester or after completion of 
the six core courses. Students who have been admitted to the Honors College may also join the major. Students may 
also request to declare the major if they meet qualifications no later than their seventh semester (student must have at 
least 2 academic semesters remaining to accommodate both the research seminar and the research project).

Computer Science Honors: Programming Language, BS  
About the Program  Students in the Computer Science Honors major, in addition to fulfilling all the requirements for a BS in Computer 
Science, will complete a dditional coursework and a research project. Honors students must maintain an overall GPA of 
3.25 plus at least a 3.6 in Computer Science and required CSHO courses. The program requirements include additional 
math coursework, three out of four selected CS and ECE courses, a research seminar and project, and a graduate level 
course. It is especially suitable for students planning on graduate level coursework, though it also offers advantages to 
students seeking employment.  
Students are invited to declare the  major if they meet the qualifications after their first semester or after completion of 
the six core courses. Students who have been admitted to the Honors College may also join the major. Students may 
also request to declare the major if they meet qualif ications no later than their seventh semester (student must have at 
least 2 academic semesters remaining to accommodate both the research seminar and the research project).  This 
concentration is designed to prepare students to work in fields related to pro gram understanding, manipulation and 
transformation. This includes run -time system engineering as well as domain specific techniques (e.g., real -time 
computing or web programming). They will acquire tools and techniques needed to specify and implement lang uage -
based solutions.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a stude nt 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the ins titutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  The myPurduePlan powe red by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment wit h the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for speci fic requirements and completion.  
Computer Science Honors: Systems Software, BS  
About the Program  
Students in the Computer Science Honors major, in addition to fulfilling all the requirements for a BS in Computer 
Science, will complete additional coursework and a research project. Honors students must maintain an overall GPA of 
3.25 plus at least a 3.6 in Computer Science and required CSHO courses. The program re quirements include additional 
math coursework, three out of four selected CS and ECE courses, a research seminar and project, and a graduate level 
course. It is especially suitable for students planning on graduate level coursework, though it also offers a dvantages to 
students seeking employment.  
Students are invited to declare the major if they meet the qualifications after their first semester or after completion of 
the six core courses. Students who have been admitted to the Honors College may also join the major. Students may 
also request to declare the major if they meet qualifications no later than their seventh semester (student must have at 
least 2 academic semesters remaining to accommodate both the research seminar and the research project).  The 
Systems Software track is designed to prepare students to become programmers who can build...  
• low-level software that uses or runs inside an operating system,  
• system tools for other users (e.g., compilers and assemblers),  
• programs that communicate over a com puter network or the Internet (e.g., web servers).

The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for e xample, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".

The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for e xample, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".

Students then take coursework in a concentration, which allows them to deepen their understa nding in a specific area. 
The Computer Graphics and Visualization concentration is designed to prepare students for work and/or for graduate 
school in computer graphics, visualization, and related areas. Computer graphics refers to modeling (including 3D 
acquisition) and rendering 3D  objects and scenes. Visualization refers to using imagery to convey digital information 
and facilitate its interpretation and analysis. Jobs and activities for students graduating from this track may include:  
Graphics -related I ndstury jobs (e.g., Intel, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Google) - working on graphics software, 
hardware, and applications.  
CAD and Architectural Applications - developing CAD/Engineering/Architecture related appliactions.  
Movie Industry (e.g., Pixar, Dr eamworks, Disney, Sony) - working on creating movies and related tools.  
Gaming Industry (e.g., Electronic Arts, Midway Games, Disney, Sony) - working on game programming and related 
tools.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identif ied as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual studen t. 
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

Department of Mathematics  
Overview  
The Department of Mathematics  is one of seven departments making up Purdue's College of Science. The Department 
has an international reputation as an outstanding cent er for mathematics.  The Department offers Bachelor of Science  and Doctor of Philosophy degrees.  Bachelor of Science programs  include 
Actuarial Science, Applied Mathematics, Core Mathematics,  Data Science, Honors Mathematics, Mathematics and 
Computer Scienc e, Mathematics for Business,  Mathematics Education, and Mathematics and Statistics.  
The Department will introduce a new degree plan:  Data Science. A major in data science puts graduates at the forefront 
of an emerging field and prepares them for an excitin g career at the intersection of computer science and statistics. Data 
Science is the interdisciplinary field of inquiry that uses quantitative and analytical methods to help gain insights and 
predictions based on big data. Students learn about key computat ional methods and statistical techniques and develop 
the deep analytical thinking skills needed to reason reliably, intelligently and creatively from data. The vast amounts of 
data generated every day has created a data -rich and data -driven world. The data  science major opens pathways to 
careers in virtually every area of society, from healthcare, security and sustainability to education, business and 
economics.  
The Department's 70 professors are actively involved in current developments in many major areas  of mathematics.

World Language Courses  
World Language proficiency requirements vary by  program. The following list is inclusive of all world languages PWL 
offers for credi t; for acceptable languages and proficiency levels, see your advisor. (ASL -American Sign Language; 
ARAB -Arabic; CHNS -Chinese; FR -French; GER -German; GREK -Greek(Ancient); HEBR -Hebrew(Biblical); HEBR -
Hebrew(Modern); ITAL -Italian; JPNS -Japenese; KOR -Korean; L ATN -Latin; PTGS=Portuguese; RUSS -Russian; 
SPAN -Spanish)  Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuan t to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like  biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an  altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course i s considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be ab le to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for  each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by Degree Works is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

specializations include:  
•  Applied Mathematics  
•  Mathematics / Business  •  Mathematics  
•  Mathematics Teaching  
•  Mathematics with Computer Science  
•  Mathematics with Statistics  
Important note: When applying for any specialization within Mathematics, select "Mathematics" as your major. You 
will have the opportunity to specialize as you progress through the curriculum.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a pa rticular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge s ource for specific requirements and completion.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "o ne that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identi fied by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.

for Theoretical Physics, the immediate past president of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching, 3 
AAAS fellows, and 10 APS fellows.   
On campus, the department occupies two buildings, the "Physics Building" (originally named th e Charles Benedict 
Stuart Laboratory of Applied Physics) and an attached two -story subterranean laboratory complex containing offices, 
work rooms, and laboratories dedicated to accelerator mass spectrometry, the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement 
Laboratory ( PRIME Lab). We also make use of campus facilities in Purdue's Discover Park, particularly the Birck 
Nanotechnology Center and the Bindley Bioscience Center. Off campus, we participate in research that occurs at the 
Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Argonne Na tional Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Fermilab, the 
Stanford Linear Accelerator, and several observatories around the globe.   
Our department has undergraduate programs in Physics, Honors Physics, Applied Physics, Applied Honors Physics, 
and Ph ysics Teaching. We also have undergraduate minors in both Astronomy and Physics. Our graduate program 
offers both M.S. and PH.D. Degrees with a wide variety of specializations.   
All physics major students must complete the majority of upper level (300 leve l and above) physics courses in 
residence at Purdue. Students can use transfer credits for no more than 50 percent of the upper level physics courses in 
order to receive a Physics and Astronomy B.S.   Degree.   
Through our outreach programs we bring our love  of physics to thousands of elementary and high school students and 
their teachers every year. Classroom visits are complete with demonstrations hands -on learning activities. Teachers 
receive high -quality, content -based professional development in our work shops and through summer research 
opportunities.

About the Program  
Purdue Physics and Astronomy is an internationally recognized department for excellence in forefront research and 
undergraduate and graduate education. Our undergraduate clas ses for physics majors  are taught by professors actively 
engaged in forefront research. Undergraduate research is strongly encouraged and opportunities exist as early as the 
second semester to work in a research group. These groups include experimental and  theoretical condensed matter 
physics, high energy physics, nano -physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, biological physics, geophysics, relativity, 
and interdisciplinary areas of material science, engineering, or computational science.  
The department also  helps undergraduates with external internships, particularly for the summers. Upon graduation our 
students are accepted for graduate programs at many of the top universities and are also sought after for positions in 
industry, particularly high -tech posit ions. Our graduates have an exceptional record of career accomplishment in a wide 
variety of settings, including academia and major industrial and government labs.  
The specialties under the applied physics curriculum can range from different areas. Individ ually tailored specialties 
may be chosen by the student in consultation with an advisor. Currently available specialties include:  
•  Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences  
•  Astrophysics  
•  Nuclear Physics  
•  Material Science & Engineering  
•  Medical Phy sics  
In addition, many physics majors manage to complete dual or multiple major programs within the College of Science. 
This is possible because of a considerable overlap of the College of Science requirements. Popular dual majors with 
physics are: mathem atics, planetary science, computer science and chemistry.  
The following stipulations need to be met in order to be in, stay in and graduate in the Honors or Applied 
Honors  Program:  
•  No D+ or worse grade is allowed in any course for a student to stay in t he Honors Programs.  
•  No more than one C range grade is allowed in all physics courses taken for a student to graduate with Honor. Note 
that a course can be re -taken for the purpose of satisfying this guideline.  
•  Both the physics AND overall GPAs of 3 .0 or better are required for a student to graduate with Honor.  
•  All the core courses (PHYS 17200, 27200, 30600, 30700, 34400, 34000, and 42200) be complete with a B or better.

Critical Course  
The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successf ul.  These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.

About the Program  
Purdue Physics and Astronomy is an internationally recognized department for excellence in f orefront research and 
undergraduate and graduate education. Our undergraduate classes for physics majors are taught by professors actively 
engaged in forefront research. Undergraduate research is strongly encouraged and opportunities exist as early as the 
second semester to work in a research group. These groups include experimental and theoretical condensed matter 
physics, high energy physics, nano -physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, biological physics, geophysics, relativity, 
and interdisciplinary are as of material science, engineering, or computational science.  The department also helps undergraduates with external internships, particularly for the summers. Upon graduation our 
students are accepted for graduate programs at many of the top universities  and are also sought after for positions in 
industry, particularly high -tech positions. Our graduates have an exceptional record of career accomplishment in a wide 
variety of settings, including academia and major industrial and government labs.  
The specia lties under the applied physics curriculum can range from different areas. Individually tailored specialties 
may be chosen by the student in consultation with an advisor. Currently available specialties include:  
•  Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences  
•  Astrophysics  
•  Nuclear Physics  
•  Material Science & Engineering  
•  Medical Physics  
In addition, many physics majors manage to complete dual or multiple major programs within the College of Science. 
This is possible because of a considerable overlap of  the College of Science requirements. Popular dual majors with 
physics are: mathematics, planetary sciences, computer science and chemistry.

World Language Courses  
World Language proficiency requirements vary by  program. The following list is inclusive of all world languages PWL 
offers for credit; for acceptable languages and proficiency levels, see your advisor. (ASL -American Sign Language; 
ARAB -Arabic; CHNS -Chinese; FR -French; GE R-German; GREK -Greek(Ancient); HEBR -Hebrew(Biblical); HEBR -
Hebrew(Modern); ITAL -Italian; JPNS -Japenese; KOR -Korean; LATN -Latin; PTGS=Portuguese; RUSS -Russian;

Critical Course  The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "one that a student 
must be able to pass to persist a nd succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identified by the institutions for each degree program".   
Disclaimer  
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.  
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.  
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.  
Physics Honors, BS  
About the Program  
Purdue Physics and Astronomy is an internationally recognized department for excellence in forefront research and 
undergraduate and graduate education. Our undergraduate classes for physics majors are taught by professors actively 
engaged in forefront research. Undergraduate research is strongly encouraged and opportunities exist as early as the 
second semester to work in a research group. These groups include experimental  and theoretical condensed matter 
physics, high energy physics, nano -physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, biological physics, geophysics, relativity, 
and interdisciplinary areas of material science, engineering, or computational science.  
The department also helps undergraduates with external internships, particularly for the summers. Upon graduation our 
students are accepted for graduate programs at many of the top universities and are also sought after for positions in 
industry, particularly high -tech p ositions. Our graduates have an exceptional record of career accomplishment in a wide 
variety of settings, including academia and major industrial and government labs.  
The honors program offers an intensive concentration in physics that provides a solid fo undation for advanced 
studies.  Successful graduates of this challenging program are recognized for both the depth and breadth of their 
physics education, and they have gone on to the premier graduate schools in the country and, ultimately, to many 
differe nt career choices.  
The honors program provides a solid theoretical and experimental background in mechanics, electromagnetism, waves 
and oscillations, thermal physics, quantum mechanics, and the micro -structure of matter.  
A very important feature of this p lan is a senior research project (PHYS 59300) with a written report in some area of 
modern physics, such as condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, elementary particle physics, biophysics, 
geophysics, etc. Students receive individual supervision and gui dance from a faculty member whose specialty matches 
the area of their research project. PHYS 59300  introduces students to the type of research atmosphere they later might 
encounter as professional physicists, and it promotes self -motivation and independenc e in their work.  
The Honors Program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy begins in the Junior Year. All physics majors 
typically start by taking PHYS 17200  and PHYS 27200  as freshmen.  Students from other majors who have taken 
PHYS 17200/PHYS 27200  may switch into the Honors Physics major.  Admission to, and continuation in, the honors 
program requires that all the core courses (PHYS 17200, PHYS 27200, PHYS 30600, PHYS 30700, PHYS 34400, 
PHYS 34000, and PHYS 42200) be complete with a B or better, or s pecial permission from the Physics Undergraduate 
Committee.  The following stipulations need to be met in order to be in, stay in and graduate in the Honors or Applied 
Honors Program:  
•  No D+ or worse grade is allowed in any course for a student to stay in  the Honors Programs.  
•  No more than one C range grade is allowed in all physics courses taken for a student to graduate with Honor. Note 
that a course can be re -taken for the purpose of satisfying this guideline.  
•  Both the physics AND overall GPAs of  3.0 or better are required for a student to graduate with Honor.  
•  All the core courses (PHYS 17200, PHYS 27200, PHYS 30600, PHYS 30700, PHYS 34400, PHYS 34000, and 
PHYS 42200) be complete with a B or better.

The ♦ course is considered critical.  
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana's Public Colleges and Universities, published by the 
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348 -2013), a Critical Course is identified as "o ne that a student 
must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should 
know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.   These would be 
identi fied by the institutions for each degree program".

About the Program  
Purdue Physics and Astronomy  is an internationally recognized department for excellence in forefront research and 
undergraduat e and graduate education. Our undergraduate classes for physics majors  are taught by professors actively 
engaged in forefront research. Undergraduate research is strongly encouraged and opportunities exist as early as the 
second semester to work in a resea rch group. These groups include experimental and theoretical condensed matter 
physics, high energy physics, nano -physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, biological physics, geophysics, relativity, 
and interdisciplinary areas of material science, engineerin g, or computational science.  
The department also helps undergraduates with external internships, particularly for the summers. Upon graduation our 
students are accepted for graduate programs at many of the top universities and are also sought after for pos itions in 
industry, particularly high -tech positions. Our graduates have an exceptional record of career accomplishment in a wide 
variety of settings, including academia and major industrial and government labs.  
This program offers a specialization in phys ics as the core of a broad general education. The core courses provide a 
solid foundation in Classical Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, Waves and Oscillations, Quantum Mechanics, 
Thermal and Statistical Physics, Modern Physics, Relativity, Electronics , and Computational Physics.   
By using electives in the program, a student can include concentrations in condensed matter physics (PHYS 54500), 
nuclear physics (PHYS 55600), astrophysics (PHYS 56000), particle physics (PHYS 56400), and other areas.  Student s also are encouraged to participate in one or two semesters of individual research projects with a selected faculty 
member (PHYS 39000, PHYS 49000,or PHYS 59000).  
Opportunities for employment in fields related to physics will also be enhanced by taking el ectives in additional 
science courses such as biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, geosciences, meteorology, and in various 
branches of engineering.  With assistance from an advisor, a student can prepare an individualized program suited to 
career plans by selecting electives from these areas or from any other area within the University.  Normally, students 
take such electives as juniors and seniors.

Overview  
Purdue University's Department of Statistics is one of the first  dedicated Statistics programs in the country. From its 
inception as a Statistical Laboratory in 1947,  it has been a prominent center of statistical research and has grown to 
become one of the largest Statistics departments in the United States. By pursuin g foundational research in probability, 
statistical theory and methodology, and computational statistics, combined with interdisciplinary research in statistical 
genetics and bioinformatics, machine learning, computational finance, industrial Statistics, a nd other fields across 
Purdue University's campus, the Department of Statistics continues the proud tradition of making fundamental 
contributions to science while developing new methodologies, theories, and algorithms for statistics and machine 
learning. I t has been a consistently top -ranked department among Statistics departments in the United States. In a world 
where data are being generated faster than they can be analyzed, the Department of Statistics promotes the design of 
meaningful experiments, obser vational studies, and surveys for data collection, the development of analysis and 
modeling methodologies for performing rigorous and valid inferences from the collected data, as well as the 
computational algorithms necessary to perform rigorous and valid inferences from the collected data and informed 
decision making based on the results of data analyses.  
Housed in both Haas Hall and the Mathematical Sciences Building, the department's diverse faculty work to advance 
the frontiers of statistical science an d data science in both theory and applications. They seek to provide learning 
environments that produce well -educated data scientists, statisticians, probabilists, and quantitatively literate people. 
They have a long history of providing cutting -edge learn ing environments conducive to successful and impactful 
graduates: https://www.stat.purdue.edu/alumni/profiles/index.html.   Through their interdisciplinary partnerships, the 
faculty, staff, and students of the department bring the strengths of the statistic al sciences to address significant societal 
needs.  
The department offers an undergraduate degree in Statistics, allowing students to focus on either Applied Statistics or 
Mathematical Statistics. Partnership with the Department of Mathematics also provides  the opportunity to major in 
Actuarial Science, while a collaboration with the Department of Computer Science enables undergraduates to pursue a 
Data Science major. Undergraduates from a range of disciplines can minor in Statistics as well. Graduate studen ts have 
access to an array of certificate, MS, and PhD programs with distinct concentrations and collaborative opportunities.  
As of March 2021, there are 36 tenured and tenure -track professors, 5 emeriti faculty, 12 adjunct and courtesy faculty 
members, 5 visiting professors, and 16 lecturers who form the Department of Statistics faculty. The department has 
approximately 538 undergraduate students majoring in Statistics and/or Actuarial Science (a joint major with the 
Department of Statistics), and 410 stud ent have the major Data Science. The department has 173 graduate students, 95 
are Ph.D. students and 78 are M.S. students.

About the Program  
Statistics at Purdue University is  one of the largest (students and faculty) in the United States. It is consistently r ated by 
U.S. News and World Report as one of the top departments in the country. It offers courses in fundamental statistics 
and probability, and also courses that focus on statistical computation to train students as future data 
scientists.  Students enjo y a great deal of interaction with faculty as well as small classes. The  department offers a 
master's program in which a student can earn both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in five years.  
The statistics major consists of two options:  
•  Applied statistics  
•  Mathematical statistics (Mathematical statistics usually leads to a double major in mathematics and statistics.)

About the Program  
Statistics at Purdue University is the only doctorate -granting program in statistics in Indiana and is one of the largest 
(students and faculty) in the United States. It is consisten tly rated by U.S. News and World Report  as one of the top 
departments in the country. Students enjoy a great deal of interaction with faculty as well as small classes. For students 
with excellent preparation in high school, the department offers a master's  program in which a student can earn both a 
bachelor's degree and a master's degree in five years.  
The statistics major consists of two options:  
•  Applied statistics  
•  Mathematical statistics (Mathematical statistics usually leads to a double major in m athematics and statistics.)
